I am a soon-to-be graduate with a profound interest in cybersecurity and a dedication to securing systems from attacks.

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
